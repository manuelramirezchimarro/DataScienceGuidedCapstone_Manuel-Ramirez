    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

      "    Notes\n",
      "    -----\n",
      "    There are several common variants of the array standard deviation\n",
      "    calculation. Assuming the input `a` is a one-dimensional NumPy array\n",
      "    and ``mean`` is either provided as an argument or computed as\n",
      "    ``a.mean()``, NumPy computes the standard deviation of an array as::\n",
      "    \n",
      "        N = len(a)\n",
      "        d2 = abs(a - mean)**2  # abs is for complex `a`\n",
      "        var = d2.sum() / (N - ddof)  # note use of `ddof`\n",
      "        std = var**0.5\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Different values of the argument `ddof` are useful in different\n",
      "    contexts. NumPy's default ``ddof=0`` corresponds with the expression:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    .. math::\n",
      "    \n",
      "        \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i{|a_i - \\bar{a}|^2 }}{N}}\n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is sometimes called the \"population standard deviation\" in the field\n",
      "    of statistics because it applies the definition of standard deviation to\n",
      "    `a` as if `a` were a complete population of possible observations.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Many other libraries define the standard deviation of an array\n",
      "    differently, e.g.:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    .. math::\n",
      "    \n",
      "        \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i{|a_i - \\bar{a}|^2 }}{N - 1}}\n",
      "    \n",
      "    In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimed called the \"sample\n",
      "    standard deviation\" because if `a` is a random sample from a larger\n",
      "    population, this calculation provides the square root of an unbiased\n",
      "    estimate of the variance of the population. The use of :math:`N-1` in the\n",
      "    denominator is often called \"Bessel's correction\" because it corrects for\n",
      "    bias (toward lower values) in the variance estimate introduced when the\n",
      "    sample mean of `a` is used in place of the true mean of the population.\n",
      "    The resulting estimate of the standard deviation is still biased, but less\n",
      "    than it would have been without the correction. For this quantity, use\n",
      "    ``ddof=1``.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute\n",
      "    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For floating-point input, the standard deviation is computed using the same\n",
      "    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause\n",
      "    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below).\n",

We've been sampling from a population we know is normally distributed, we've come to understand when to use $n$ and when to use $n-1$ in the denominator to calculate the spread of a distribution, and we've  seen the Central Limit Theorem in action for a sampling distribution. All seems very well behaved in Frequentist land. But, well, why should we really care?"

If we want to make inferences to conclusions like \"this observation is unusual\" or \"my population mean has changed\" then we need to have some idea of what the underlying distribution is so we can calculate relevant probabilities. In frequentist inference, we use the formulae above to deduce these population parameters. Take a moment in the next part of this assignment to refresh your understanding of how these probabilities work."

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places.
